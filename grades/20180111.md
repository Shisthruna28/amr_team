- Well done!
- There is typo in the code, line 79 should be data.angle_increment.
- The sigma should not be compared directly to the difference in the measurement. Instead, that would mean to discard values that are sigma (standard deviation) away from the distribution's mean.
- The position of the laser beams should take into account the orientation of the requested pose. Use a transformation matrix instead of just adding.
